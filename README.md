# GroceryListDatabase
GroceryList App using Core Data Database

<h2>About/Usage</h2>
This app was designed to allow the user to save grocery lists for whatever type of category they desire. To add a new list, press the "+" button on the main screen. Once the "Save" button is pressed, the list is added into the user's iPhone database in a SQL format using SQLite. After adding a list, the user can then select the list to be able to add items to it and delete items that are no longer needed. This app takes advantage of Apple's CoreData framework to access and call from the iPhone's central database.
